<p>The cat is a beautiful small animal resembling the likes of <b>a tiger</b> . It lives on the streets as well as in our houses and is one of our favourite pet animals. <i> The catâ€™s body is covered with soft, silky hair and has four short legs </i> and sharp claws hidden in the fleshy pads. <br>
    Cats seldom make any noise while walking or running. Cats have bright eyes and <span style="background-color: brown;"> they can even see in the dark </span>. Cat is found all over the world and milk is cats favourite. Many people keep cats as their pets to scare away the mice. <span style="color: crimson;"> But unlike dogs, cats are selfish and dishonest</span>. Cats even steal food from our kitchen and are very ferocious at times.
