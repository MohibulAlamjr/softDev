   <p>The cat is a beautiful small animal resembling the likes of <b>a tiger</b>. It lives on the streets as well as in our houses and is one of our favourite pet animals. The catâ€™s body is covered with soft, silky hair and has four short legs and sharp claws hidden in the fleshy pads.<br>Cats seldom make any noise while walking or running. Cats have bright eyes and <span style="background-color: palegreen;">they can even see in the dark.</span> Cat is found all over the world and milk is cats favourite. Many people keep cats as their pets to scare away the mice. <span style="color: rgb(243, 6, 25);">But unlike dogs, cats are selfish and dishonest.</span> Cats even steal food from our kitchen and are very ferocious at times.</p>
